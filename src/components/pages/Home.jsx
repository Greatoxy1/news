                Russian–Ukrainian cyberwarfare is a component of the confrontation between Russia and Ukraine since the Revolution of Dignity in 2013–2014.
                Russian cyberweapon Uroburos had been around since 2005.[1] However, the first attacks on information systems of private enterprises and state institutions of Ukraine were recorded during mass protests in 2013.
                In 2013, Operation Armageddon, a Russian campaign of systematic cyber espionage on the information systems of government agencies, law enforcement, and defense agencies, began, thought to help Russia on the battlefield.
                [2] Between 2013 and 2014, some information systems of Ukrainian government agencies were affected by a computer virus known as Snake / Uroborus / Turla.[2] In February–March 2014, as Russian troops entered Crimea communication centers were raided and Ukraine's fibre optic cables were tampered with,
                cutting connection between the peninsula and mainland Ukraine. Additionally Ukrainian Government websites, news and social media were shut down or targeted in DDoS attacks, while cell phones of many Ukrainian parliamentarians were hacked or jammed.
                [2][3] Ukrainian experts also stated the beginning of a cyberwar with Russia.
                In April 2022, Microsoft report shared new details on Russian cyberwarfare against Ukraine, for instance Microsoft has reported that in some cases, hacking and military operations worked in tandem against Ukraine related target.
                The primary aim is cyberwarfare against Russia. Fedorov requested the assistance of cyber specialist and tweeted a Telegram with a list of 31 websites of Russian business and state organizations.
                Many people are asking, when will this global conflicts end?.

                The war is an ongoing international conflict between Russia (alongside Russian-backed separatists) and Ukraine which began in February 2014. Following Ukraine's Revolution of Dignity, Russia annexed Ukrainian Crimea and supported pro-Russian separatists fighting the Ukrainian military in the Donbas war. The first eight years of conflict included naval incidents, cyberwarfare, and heightened political tensions.
                In February 2022, Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in a major escalation of the conflict.
                The 20-point plan differs from the November 2025 28-point plan in significant ways. The 28-point plan called for Ukraine to withdraw from the remainder of unoccupied Donbas (Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts), for the creation of a demilitarized zone in Donbas that would be internationally recognized as de facto Russian territory, and for the war to freeze along the current frontline in Zaporizhia and Kherson oblasts.[4] The 28-point plan also capped the Ukrainian military during peacetime at 600,000 personnel and called for Ukraine to abandon its efforts to seek NATO membership.
                The 20-point plan, in contrast, calls for the war to freeze in Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhia, and Kherson oblasts along the frontline as of the date of the agreement’s signing; caps Ukraine’s peacetime military at 800,000; and does not mention Ukraine’s possible NATO membership.

                The source reportedly stated that Russia’s concerns about the document include the lack of guarantees prohibiting NATO’s eastward expansion, insufficient limits on Ukraine’s peacetime military forces and weapons, the lack of provisions about Ukraine’s neutral status should Ukraine join the EU, and the lack of assurances about the status of the Russian language in Ukraine.
                Bloomberg reported that the source stated that the Kremlin also wants provisions on frozen Russian assets and the removal of Western sanctions in the peace proposal. The Kremlin has repeatedly called for any future peace settlement to eliminate the alleged “root causes” of the war, which the Kremlin defines as NATO expansion and Ukraine’s alleged discrimination against Russian speakers.
                [12] Russia’s demonstrated unwillingness to engage in compromises and its unwavering commitment to achieving its original war goals from 2022 suggest that the prospects for this peace agreement to end the war remain low at this time.

                HOW TENSION IS INCREASING BETWEEN USA AND VENEZUELA
            </h1>
            <p>
                “The Secretary-General is deeply alarmed by the recent escalation in Venezuela, culminating with today’s United States military action in the country, which has potential worrying implications for the region,” said a statement issued by UN Spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric.
                US President Donald Trump made the announcement on social media, and the US Attorney General said Mr. Maduro and his wife would face “the full wrath of American justice on American soil, in American courts,” based on a 2020 narcoterrorism indictment during the first Trump administration, in New York.
                The United States conducted an early morning strike in Venezuela on Saturday, Jan. 3, and captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.

                After being captured, Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were taken to New York to face charges. The "large scale strike against Venezuela" was done "in conjunction with U.S. Law Enforcement," President Donald Trump said in a post on Truth Social just after 4 a.m. ET on Saturday, Jan. 3.

                The attack comes just more than a month after Trump designated Maduro and his government allies of a foreign terrorist organization. And it also comes 36 years to the day from when the U.S. captured Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega, the last time the U.S. made such a bold military action in the region.

            <p>
                The UN Secretary-General António Guterres has said he is “deeply alarmed” over the standoff between the United States and Venezuela in recent months, which culminated on Saturday morning in the capture of President Nicolás Maduro by US special forces.
                The US operation began with overnight strikes in and around the capital, Caracas. Venezuela has declared a state of national emergency, with casualty figures and some other acts.
                During a press conference at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida late Saturday morning, President Trump said that the US intended to “run Venezuela” until there is a “safe, proper and judicious transition” of power.
                This is one of the discussions circurating on the globe,can it be possible?.

                Can this current act bring war between venezuela and USA?
            </h1>
            <p>
                Short answer: it’s very unlikely that Trump’s actions would directly lead to a war between the U.S. and Venezuela.

                Here’s a clear breakdown:
                <h1>
                    What people usually mean by “Trump’s act”
                </h1>
                When this comes up, it’s usually about Trump’s policies toward Venezuela, such as:
                <br></br>
                1.Economic sanctions on the Maduro government
                <br></br>
                2.Pressure to remove Nicolás Maduro and support for opposition leaders
                <br></br>
                3.Restrictions or changes related to Venezuelan oil.

                These are coercive political and economic tools, not military ones.
                <h1>
                    Why a war is unlikely
                </h1>
                .1. No strong U.S. incentive: Venezuela does not pose a direct military threat to the U.S.
                <br></br>
                .2. High cost, low benefit: A war would be expensive, risky, and unpopular domestically and internationally.
                <br></br>
                .3 . History matters: Even during Trump’s first presidency—when rhetoric was very tough—no war happened.
                <br></br>
                .4. International backlash: Military action would likely face strong opposition from allies and international organizations.
                <h1>
                    What could realistically happen
                </h1>
                <br></br>
                .1. Increased economic pressure on Venezuela
                <br></br>
                .2. Diplomatic isolation of the Maduro government
                <br></br>
                .3.Tensions or aggressive language, but not armed conflict.
                <br></br>
                <h1>
                    What would make war more likely (still unlikely)
                </h1>
                Only extreme events—like attacks on U.S. personnel, a major regional conflict, or a complete collapse causing widespread instability—could raise the risk, and none of those are currently inevitable.


                Trump’s actions can increase tension, but war between the U.S. and Venezuela is not a realistic or expected outcome.

                3.Russia has condemned the U.S. action as unlawful and says it destabilizes the region, warning similar acts against stronger states could be seen as acts of war.
                <br></br>
                4.Some European or Latin American leaders warn this precedent could encourage rival powers (like Russia/China) to escalate global tensions.

                WHAT ACTIONS MUST THE UNITED NATION TAKE BEFORE IS TOO LATE
            </h1>
            <p>
                Domestic pressure inside the U.S.

                In the U.S., Congress, courts, media, and public opinion can limit or reverse aggressive actions.

                Democracies have internal brakes on long wars.
                This problem can be solved by slowing things down, involving neutral mediators, negotiating step-by-step agreements, and keeping the focus on diplomacy rather than force.
                The UN Secretary-General can publicly urge both sides to stop military actions.

                This helps lower tension and signals that the world is watching.

                ➡️ It doesn’t force anyone, but it creates pressure to pause.
                The Security Council can meet to discuss the crisis.

                Countries present evidence, concerns, and proposals.
                The UN can appoint a neutral special envoy.

                The envoy talks separately with the U.S., Venezuelan leaders, and regional countries.
                The UN often works with Latin American regional groups.

                Neighboring countries help push for peaceful solutions because instability affects them most.
                The UN’s role is to slow things down, bring everyone to the table, protect civilians, and replace force with dialogue and law.
                That’s often how big crises avoid turning into full wars.
            </p>
            <img src="usvz4.avif" alt="image"></img>
            <p>
                The UN cannot enforce decisions by force unless countries volunteer troops.

If countries refuse, UN decisions may have no real consequences.
When national security, power, or money are involved, countries may act without UN approval.

International law is strong on paper, weaker in practice.

➡️ The UN cannot arrest or punish powerful states easily.

                Each one has veto power, meaning one country alone can block any decision.

➡️ If a resolution goes against the interests of any of these five, it usually doesn’t pass.
UN peacekeeping missions are tools to maintain peace, not create it.
They work best after diplomacy, not instead of it.
A UN peacekeeping mission would only be possible if violence stopped

Both sides would need to agree to it

Its role would be to stabilize, not control Venezuela.

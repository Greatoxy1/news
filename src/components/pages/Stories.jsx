                Africa is having multi talented and well train kids
                who perform both acrobatic and other fantastic arts.

                This kids have performed many more acrobats and deserve applauds
                not only from Africa but over the World.
                The current landscape of acrobatics is characterized by a blend of traditional disciplines and modern fitness trends. Adult acrobatics has surged in popularity, offering a holistic approach to physical fitness that combines strength, flexibility, coordination, and balance.
                This trend is particularly evident in Dubai, where adult acrobatics has become a burgeoning fitness option, with state-of-the-art facilities and experienced trainers contributing to the fitness culture in the region.
                The demand for diverse and engaging fitness options is driving the growth of specialized studios and training programs, aligning with the UAE’s commitment to enhancing the fitness and gymnastics contribute to the development of the arms, legs, shoulders, back, chest, and abdominal muscle groups.
                Gymnastics evolved from exercises used by the ancient Greeks that included skills for mounting and dismounting a horse.[2]

                The most common form of competitive gymnastics is artistic gymnastics (AG); for women, the events include floor, vault, uneven bars, and balance beam; for men, besides floor and vault, it includes rings, pommel horse, parallel bars, and horizontal bar.

                Every year, the magazine publishes several specialty issues. These issues were often published as double issues (running for two consecutive weeks). Many times these features were so long that they replaced all other feature articles.

                Common specialty issues include:

                Spring, Summer, Fall, and Winter Preview issues: Generally each quarter, the magazine reports on upcoming releases in movies, music, television, live shows, and books. Typically, the summer issue's focus is on upcoming movies only unless major television series or events, music releases, or book releases are occurring then.
                The Photo issue: Once a year, an issue is dedicated to featuring (aside from the normal reviews and news content) only photographs of celebrities. Unlike tabloid issues, these photographs are done with the celebrities' cooperation, and often they use some form of artistic expression. A wide variety of celebrities has been used, including Green Day, Reese Witherspoon, Morrissey, the cast of the television series Arrested Development,
                Tobey Maguire, and Cameron Diaz. Generally, the photographs contain some descriptive text, sometimes about the person or sometimes a commentary from the photographers who photographed them for a story.
                Academy Awards issues: In the past, the magazine devoted at least four cover stories per year to the Academy Awards; "The Oscar Race Begins" issue in January predicted the nominees, the "Nominees" issue in February profiled the recently announced Oscar contenders, the "Oscar Odds" issue predicted the winners the week before the awards, and the "After-Awards" issue covered the ceremony the week after it airs. Virtually every issue mentioned the Oscars in some capacity,
                often on the cover, and a film or actor's Academy Award chances were often noted in the magazine's reviews. In comparison, music's Grammy Awards, television's Emmy Awards, and theater's Tony Awards are given relatively limited coverage.
                The "Must List": A double-sized issue, it was usually timed for release in the last week of June. It focuses on what the magazine considers "musts" in entertainment with the latest hot movies, TV shows, music projects and novels along with previews of upcoming projects in those media that are gaining interest.
                The Fall TV Preview issue: Generally released in early September, this issue has the magazine detailing the upcoming fall season of both new and returning series.
                End-of-the-Year issue: The last issue of each year, whose cover shows the "Entertainer of the Year" chosen by readers at EW's official website. The issue features the ten-best releases in theater, film, television, music, DVD, literature and (as of last year) fashion that year. Music, television and film have two critics give their top ten; the others only have one.
                Each section also has a five-worst list (film is the only section in which both critics give the worst). Also in the issue are special sections devoted to the Entertainer of the Year, great performances, newly arrived stars, a timeline of infamous celebrity mishaps, and obituaries of stars who died (this used to be in a separate issue; it was combined with the "end-of-the-year" issue in 2003). This is the only issue without any reviews.
                The complete list of the annual "Entertainer of the Year" winners:

                How the world embrasses gymnastics
            </h1>
            <p>
                The word gymnastics derives from the common Greek adjective γυμνός (gymnos),[4] by way of the related verb γυμνάζω (gymnazo),
                whose meaning is to "train naked", "train in gymnastic exercise", generally "to train, to exercise".
                [5] The verb had this meaning because athletes in ancient times exercised and competed without clothing.
                The governing body for competition in gymnastics throughout the world is World Gymnastics. Eight sports are governed by the FIG, including gymnastics for all, men's and women's artistic gymnastics, rhythmic gymnastics (women's branch only), trampolining (including double mini-trampoline), tumbling, acrobatic, aerobic, parkour and para-gymnastics.[3] Disciplines not currently recognized by FIG include wheel gymnastics, aesthetic group gymnastics,
                TeamGym, men's rhythmic gymnastics (both the Spanish form which is identical to the women's version and the Japanese version which is a different sport) and mallakhamba.

                Participants in gymnastics-related sports include young children, recreational-level athletes, and competitive athletes at all skill levels.

                By 1954, Olympic Games apparatus and events for men and women had been standardized in a modern format, and uniform grading structures (including a point system from 1 to 15) had been agreed upon.
                In 1930, the first UK mass movement organization of women in gymnastics, the Women's League of Health and Beauty, was founded by Mary Bagot Stack in London.
                [18] At this time, Soviet gymnasts astounded the world with highly disciplined and difficult performances, setting a precedent that continues.
                Television has helped publicize and initiate a modern age of gymnastics.
                Both men's and women's gymnastics now attract considerable international interest, and excellent gymnasts can be found on every continent.
                In 2001, the traditional vaulting horse was replaced with a new apparatus, sometimes known as a tongue, horse, or vaulting table. The new apparatus is more stable, wider, and longer than the older vaulting horse,
                approximately 1 metre (3.3 ft) in length and 1 metre (3.3 ft) in width, giving gymnasts a larger blocking surface.
                This apparatus is thus considered safer than the vaulting horse used in the past. With the addition of this new, safer vaulting table, gymnasts are attempting more difficult vaults.

                In 2006, FIG introduced a new point system for artistic gymnastics.[19] Unlike the old code of points, in which there was a maximum 10.0 score, there are two separate scores that are added to produce the final score.
                The first is the execution score, which starts at 10 and has deductions taken for execution mistakes, and the second is the difficulty score, which is open-ended and based on what elements the gymnasts perform.
                It may be lower than the intended difficulty score if the gymnast does not perform or complete all the skills,
                or they do not connect a skill meant to be connected to another. Scoring for national developmental levels or outside of the FIG competition system may continue to use the 10.0 system; for example, US women's collegiate gymnastics still uses the 10.0 system.
                According to FIG rules, only women compete in rhythmic gymnastics. This is a sport that combines elements of ballet, gymnastics, dance, and apparatus manipulation, with a much greater emphasis on the aesthetic rather than the acrobatic.
                [25] Gymnasts compete either as individuals or in groups. Individuals perform four separate routines, each using one of the four apparatuses—ball, ribbon, hoop, clubs, and formerly, rope—on a floor area. Groups consist of five gymnasts who perform two routines together,
                one with five of the same apparatus and one with three of one apparatus and two of another; the FIG defines which apparatuses groups use each year.

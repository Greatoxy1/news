                    Dangerous way of how people risk their lives to enter europe

                The European Union is in the process of reforming its migration, asylum, integration,
                and border management policies, but critics say any new rules should address its tactics that facilitate  migrant pushbacks and deaths at sea.
                The EU's migration and asylum policies have contributed to making this journey more lethal. Its member states do not actively search for or assist migrants crossing the Mediterranean unless a vessel is in distress and issues an emergency call.
                This procedure has prompted traffickers to send unsafe, overcrowded boats into the sea in the hope that they will be rescued by Frontex,
                the European border agency, or the coast guards of EU member states such as Italy or Greece.
                At the European Council meeting on 26 and 27 June, the strategic guidelines for shaping the EU’s future approach to asylum and migration were adopted. Despite some positive language on human rights,
                the guidelines fall short in some key areas.

                On the three key measures we had called for, we welcome the acknowledgment in the guidelines of the need to increase contributions to global resettlement, particularly considering the Syria crisis.
                We also welcome the Council’s recognition that "it will be crucial to ensure the protection and promotion of fundamental rights... also in relations with third countries".

                But the guidelines also propose as a solution increasing cooperation with non-EU countries to prevent refugees and migrants leaving, despite all evidence that prevention and deterrence policies have been failing and have a devastating impact on people.

                EU leaders also missed the opportunity to give clear guidance on the need to develop measures that could provide other safe routes (in addition to resettlement) to protection in Europe, and for concerted action to save lives at sea.

                Nevertheless, a concerted EU response is a priority for Italy (which holds the Presidency of the EU from July to December 2014) and is urgently needed given the scale of arrivals at sea.

                The EU's priority appears to be to prevent people from entering its territory at all costs, even if those people are in need of safety and protection.
                The European Commission allocated Greece more than 10 times the budget to keep refugees and migrants out from 2011 to 2013 than to assist their reception.
                No matter how high European countries build their walls, and no matter how often they shift responsibility to neighbouring countries,
                people will still be compelled to flee persecution, conflict and poverty by coming to the EU.

                EU member states must accept this and work to protect, not punish, those attempting to reach their borders.
                Refugees and migrants are risking their lives to reach Europe. Many have fled conflict and poverty.
                If they make it to the borders, they are often met with violence and ill-treatment. Again and again their human rights are denied.
                In June, David Cameron met with European heads of states to consider an asylum and migration strategy. In the months leading up to the meeting, Amnesty supporters around Europe called on their representative at the meeting to put human rights at the heart of the strategy.

                In the UK, over 5,000 people emailed their MP, asking them to raise the issue with the Prime Minister before he travelled to the meeting.

                Thanks to supporters around the UK, over 99% of MPs were emailed by their constituents asking them to support the campaign.

                </a>
            </div>

            <p>
                From global research ,some countries have good treatments for migrants after their resque.
                The most treatment they commonly get is medical treatment,financial support and accommodation
                The perilous journey over the Atlantic Ocean has become an increasingly common route for African migrants trying to reach Europe.
                Nearly 47,000 people reached the Canary Islands in 2024 and some non-government organisation estimates more than 10,000 migrants have died.
                The bodies of the seven people who drowned have been recovered, and 10 of those rescued are said to be in critical condition and receiving urgent medical care.

                The Gambia is one of the routes used by migrants trying to reach Europe, often on dangerous journeys by sea and land.

                In recent years, the European Union has reached agreements with several North African countries aimed at reducing irregular migration.

            </div>
            <p>
                🟦 AGAINST the motion (stronger, more realistic position)

                Claim: Illegal migration cannot be completely stopped, only reduced.

                Arguments:

                Push factors are stronger than borders

                War, hunger, climate disasters, and persecution force people to move.

                Desperate people will always find ways around barriers.

                History proves enforcement alone fails

                Countries with walls, patrols, and strict laws still experience illegal migration.

                Routes change, but movement continues.

                Legal systems are too slow or limited

                When legal migration is nearly impossible, illegal migration increases.

                People don’t choose illegality first — they choose survival.

                Smugglers adapt

                Criminal networks adjust faster than governments.

                Blocking one route opens another, often more dangerous.

                Conclusion line:

                “You can slow migration, manage it, and make it safer — but you cannot stop human movement driven by survival.”

                🟩 FOR the motion (arguable but harder)

                Claim: Illegal migration can be stopped with strong, coordinated action.

                Arguments:

                Strict enforcement deters attempts

                Consistent border control reduces incentives to cross illegally.

                Clear consequences discourage repeat attempts.

                Technology increases control

                Surveillance, biometrics, and data sharing make borders harder to cross undetected.

                International agreements work

                When transit and origin countries cooperate, migration drops.

                Shared responsibility increases effectiveness.

                Fast deportation systems

                Quick, predictable enforcement removes incentives to stay illegally.

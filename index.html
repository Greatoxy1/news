      <h2>
        In today's modern world, global conflicts continue to erupt across continents, making peace increasingly difficult to achieve. 
        These wars often serve the interests of individual states rather than benefiting the global economy. 
        Nations with vested interests in these conflicts contribute to their escalation, turning the world into a more dangerous place.

        The consequences of these wars are devastating.
        In some countries, children are dying, people are being treated unfairly, and innocent lives are being lost. 
        This is a world filled with sorrow, and it demands our attention and action.

        Additionally, the blame goes to the United nation, ONG , and other international organizations that fail to prevent these conflicts.
        Their inability to act decisively allows wars to persist, causing further harm to innocent civilians.
        We are in a world that no one must be trasted.
        The one you trust today will be your enemy tomorrow, they only comes to your aid if you can go and agree terms with them!
        The poor countries are suffering because they have nothing to offer for their protection,
        and what will happen is that the enemy will use it as opportunity to recover your land and destroy your people.
        The world with fool of agony.

        It is crucial for the global community to come together and work towards ending these conflicts.
        We must prioritize diplomacy, understanding, and cooperation over violence and aggression.
        Only through collective efforts can we hope to create a world where peace prevails and conflicts are resolved without bloodshed.
        The time will come when the world will be peaceful and no one will suffer anymore.
        Only fiew people understand that there will be peace but it will take time to resolve,
        There is incoming messiah that will come and bring peace to the world.
        Until then, we must remain vigilant and committed to the cause of peace.
        What makes it wonder is that the messiah will come from AFRICA and he will change the style of AFRICA and the World.
        No one can stop him if he start his mission, because he will be under control of the universe.
        The man is yet unknown but he is alive and he will arise soon.

        In conclusion, the ongoing global conflicts are a grave concern that requires immediate attention and action.
        We must work together to promote peace, protect innocent lives, and create a better future for all.
        The world deserves peace, and it is our collective responsibility to make it a reality.
        I will bring you the name of the messiah at the right time.
